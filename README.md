# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Final Project

## Theme
struggled initally as i realized the idea i was coding tecnically involved two buttons, i was thinking in the perspective of a mobile game where you would tap either side of the screen. Upon realizing this i decided to use one button to both stop and restart the game.

## Game Play
Objective
Game-play instructions
play as Space Granny and avoid oncomming laser attacks from space foes! But be careful, the game only gets more challenging asyou play it!
## What did you 
Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game
I wanted to make an arcade style game, in order to make it keep that feel i had to make it "infinite" in a way. Making a looping track was the biggest stuggle for me,

## Special Focus
What is your special focus? What did you do for it? How would you rate your own effort? 1-5. (I will agree or disagree with this sentiment, but I want to know what you thought)
I chose to try and make something somewhat comedic, but also a game that could be passed around a table of  friends. When creating this, I envisioned sitting at a table with my close friends passing around a simple arcade game to see who could get the highest score. My friends and i used to love dowloading random low quality apps off the appstore and having a bit of fun with them, the idea of one of those games being something i put effort into makes me smile. 
Another thing i focused on was the general aesthetic of my game. As someone just starting out with programming, everything i make is ultimately preety crude and rudamentery. But instead of letting this make me feel down i decided to lean into it a bit, I've been a digital artist since i was little and ive noticed that theres a certain look or feel to art made by beginners that cant be captured by more experienced artists. i tried to capture a bit of that silly and almost absurd feeling into my work. With this I try to make my games almost feel "fake" like something youd see in the background of an adult swim show, i felt this all adds to the comedy i tried to achieve.
I'd like to rate my effort a 3.5 or 4, i used a lot of outside resources to create my game but piecing them all together was the real challenge to me and thats what i put most of my effort into.

PS:
Thank you so much for everything with this class! I had so so much fun, it was such a fun challenge to try somwthing new and flex a different artistic muscle. I also appreciate all the help and grace given when it came to my shoddy computer, its brand new and i wasnt expecting it to act that way as it had relitively good optics.
